There are four types of Kaposi\'s sarcoma: (1) Classic: elderly Jewish or Mediterranean man. Is is a rare form and progresses slowly over the years, usually affect the legs; (2) Endemic or African KS: young males who live near the African equator and have a normal immune system; (3) KS in immunosuppression: with aggressive course with visceral involvement, usually develops in people following organ transplantation and mostly affects the skin; and AIDS related: life-threatening with many skin, gut and lung lesions more frequent in homo or bisexial men.\nClinical features include: skin lesions (nodular, papular or blotchy that may be purple, red, brown or black) which can be seen under or on mucous membranes, more often in the mouth, nose and throat. This lesions are usually painless but may become painful if swollen or inflamed. This lesions may also involve internal organs (e.g. lung leading to dyspnoea, gastrointestinal tract leading life-threatening bleeding and lymphatics leading to lymphoedema).

This lesions are usually painless but may become painful if swollen or inflamed. This lesions may also involve internal organs (e.g. lung leading to dyspnoea, gastrointestinal tract leading life-threatening bleeding and lymphatics leading to lymphoedema).

Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, tonsillar enlargement classically exudative and may be massive, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, tiredness, palatal petechiae, and malaise. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur. Diagnosis is made by the heterophile antibody test (Monospot test -Paul Bunnell-), a screening test that gives results within a day, but has significantly less than full sensitivity (70–92%) in the first two weeks after clinical symptoms begin. Serological tests take longer time than the heterophile antibody test, but are more accurate. Laboratory testing most reveal increased white cell count with lymphocytosis and a relative atypical lymphocyte count greater than 20% and ESR is increased.

Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, tonsillar enlargement classically exudative and may be massive, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, tiredness, palatal petechiae, and malaise. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur. Diagnosis is made by the heterophile antibody test (Monospot test -Paul Bunnell-), a screening test that gives results within a day, but has significantly less than full sensitivity (70–92%) in the first two weeks after clinical symptoms begin. Serological tests take longer time than the heterophile antibody test, but are more accurate.

Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications.\nClinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust.\nPruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying.\nVaricella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies.

There are four types of Kaposi\'s sarcoma: (1) Classic: elderly Jewish or Mediterranean man. Is is a rare form and progresses slowly over the years, usually affect the legs; (2) Endemic or African KS: young males who live near the African equator and have a normal immune system; (3) KS in immunosuppression: with aggressive course with visceral involvement, usually develops in people following organ transplantation and mostly affects the skin; and AIDS related: life-threatening with many skin, gut and lung lesions more frequent in homo or bisexial men.\nClinical features include: skin lesions (nodular, papular or blotchy that may be purple, red, brown or black) which can be seen under or on mucous membranes, more often in the mouth, nose and throat. This lesions are usually painless but may become painful if swollen or inflamed. This lesions may also involve internal organs (e.g. lung leading to dyspnoea, gastrointestinal tract leading life-threatening bleeding and lymphatics leading to lymphoedema).

Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications.\nClinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust.\nPruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying.\nVaricella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies.

The malignant lesion is characterised by neoplasic cells and abnormally growing blood vessels. Lesions may appear in more than one place simultaneously. There are four types of Kaposi\'s sarcoma: (1) Classic: elderly Jewish or Mediterranean man. Is is a rare form and progresses slowly over the years, usually affect the legs; (2) Endemic or African KS: young males who live near the African equator and have a normal immune system; (3) KS in immunosuppression: with aggressive course with visceral involvement, usually develops in people following organ transplantation and mostly affects the skin; and AIDS related: life-threatening with many skin, gut and lung lesions more frequent in homo or bisexial men.\nClinical features include: skin lesions (nodular, papular or blotchy that may be purple, red, brown or black) which can be seen under or on mucous membranes, more often in the mouth, nose and throat. This lesions are usually painless but may become painful if swollen or inflamed. This lesions may also involve internal organs (e.g. lung leading to dyspnoea, gastrointestinal tract leading life-threatening bleeding and lymphatics leading to lymphoedema).

Is is a rare form and progresses slowly over the years, usually affect the legs; (2) Endemic or African KS: young males who live near the African equator and have a normal immune system; (3) KS in immunosuppression: with aggressive course with visceral involvement, usually develops in people following organ transplantation and mostly affects the skin; and AIDS related: life-threatening with many skin, gut and lung lesions more frequent in homo or bisexial men.\nClinical features include: skin lesions (nodular, papular or blotchy that may be purple, red, brown or black) which can be seen under or on mucous membranes, more often in the mouth, nose and throat. This lesions are usually painless but may become painful if swollen or inflamed. This lesions may also involve internal organs (e.g. lung leading to dyspnoea, gastrointestinal tract leading life-threatening bleeding and lymphatics leading to lymphoedema).

Chickenpox is a highly infectious airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. Incubation period is about 10 to 21 days. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications.\nClinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust.\nPruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying.\nVaricella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies.

Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever is caused is an infection usually caused by the Epstein&ndash;Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4). Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, tonsillar enlargement classically exudative and may be massive, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, tiredness, palatal petechiae, and malaise. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur. Diagnosis is made by the heterophile antibody test (Monospot test -Paul Bunnell-), a screening test that gives results within a day, but has significantly less than full sensitivity (70&ndash;92%) in the first two weeks after clinical symptoms begin. Serological tests take longer time than the heterophile antibody test, but are more accurate. Laboratory testing most reveal increased white cell count with lymphocytosis and a relative atypical lymphocyte count greater than 20% and ESR is increased. Management is supportive, with analgesics.

Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever is caused is an infection usually caused by the Epstein&ndash;Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4). Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, tonsillar enlargement classically exudative and may be massive, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, tiredness, palatal petechiae, and malaise. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur. Diagnosis is made by the heterophile antibody test (Monospot test -Paul Bunnell-), a screening test that gives results within a day, but has significantly less than full sensitivity (70&ndash;92%) in the first two weeks after clinical symptoms begin. Serological tests take longer time than the heterophile antibody test, but are more accurate. Laboratory testing most reveal increased white cell count with lymphocytosis and a relative atypical lymphocyte count greater than 20% and ESR is increased. Management is supportive, with analgesics.

Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever is caused is an infection usually caused by the Epstein&ndash;Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4). Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, tonsillar enlargement classically exudative and may be massive, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, tiredness, palatal petechiae, and malaise. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur. Diagnosis is made by the heterophile antibody test (Monospot test -Paul Bunnell-), a screening test that gives results within a day, but has significantly less than full sensitivity (70&ndash;92%) in the first two weeks after clinical symptoms begin. Serological tests take longer time than the heterophile antibody test, but are more accurate. Laboratory testing most reveal increased white cell count with lymphocytosis and a relative atypical lymphocyte count greater than 20% and ESR is increased. Management is supportive, with analgesics.

It is important to remember that reactivarion of the dormant virus after a bout of chickenpox leads to herpes zoster (shingles). Chickenpox is a highly infectious airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. Incubation period is about 10 to 21 days. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications. Clinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust. Pruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies. Aciclovir must be administered to pregnant women or immunocompromised patients who develop the disease.

The malignant lesion is characterised by neoplasic cells and abnormally growing blood vessels. Lesions may appear in more than one place simultaneously. There are four types of Kaposi\'s sarcoma: (1) Classic: elderly Jewish or Mediterranean man. Is is a rare form and progresses slowly over the years, usually affect the legs; (2) Endemic or African KS: young males who live near the African equator and have a normal immune system; (3) KS in immunosuppression: with aggressive course with visceral involvement, usually develops in people following organ transplantation and mostly affects the skin; and AIDS related: life-threatening with many skin, gut and lung lesions more frequent in homo or bisexial men. Clinical features include: skin lesions (nodular, papular or blotchy that may be purple, red, brown or black) which can be seen under or on mucous membranes, more often in the mouth, nose and throat. This lesions are usually painless but may become painful if swollen or inflamed. This lesions may also involve internal organs (e.g. lung leading to dyspnoea, gastrointestinal tract leading life-threatening bleeding and lymphatics leading to lymphoedema).

In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, tonsillar enlargement classically exudative and may be massive, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, tiredness, palatal petechiae, and malaise. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur.

Chickenpox is a highly infectious airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. Incubation period is about 10 to 21 days. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications. Clinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust. Pruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies.

It is important to remember that reactivarion of the dormant virus after a bout of chickenpox leads to herpes zoster (shingles). Chickenpox is a highly infectious airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. Incubation period is about 10 to 21 days. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications. Clinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust. Pruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies.

There are four types of Kaposi\'s sarcoma: (1) Classic: elderly Jewish or Mediterranean man. Is is a rare form and progresses slowly over the years, usually affect the legs; (2) Endemic or African KS: young males who live near the African equator and have a normal immune system; (3) KS in immunosuppression: with aggressive course with visceral involvement, usually develops in people following organ transplantation and mostly affects the skin; and AIDS related: life-threatening with many skin, gut and lung lesions more frequent in homo or bisexial men. Clinical features include: skin lesions (nodular, papular or blotchy that may be purple, red, brown or black) which can be seen under or on mucous membranes, more often in the mouth, nose and throat. This lesions are usually painless but may become painful if swollen or inflamed. This lesions may also involve internal organs (e.g. lung leading to dyspnoea, gastrointestinal tract leading life-threatening bleeding and lymphatics leading to lymphoedema).

Chickenpox is a highly infectious airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. Incubation period is about 10 to 21 days. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications. Clinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust. Pruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies.

Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, tonsillar enlargement classically exudative and may be massive, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, tiredness, palatal petechiae, and malaise. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur. Diagnosis is made by the heterophile antibody test (Monospot test -Paul Bunnell-), a screening test that gives results within a day, but has significantly less than full sensitivity (70&ndash;92%) in the first two weeks after clinical symptoms begin. Serological tests take longer time than the heterophile antibody test, but are more accurate. Laboratory testing most reveal increased white cell count with lymphocytosis and a relative atypical lymphocyte count greater than 20% and ESR is increased. Management is supportive, with analgesics.

It is important to remember that reactivarion of the dormant virus after a bout of chickenpox leads to herpes zoster (shingles). Chickenpox is a highly infectious airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. Incubation period is about 10 to 21 days. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications. Clinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust. Pruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies.

Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, tonsillar enlargement classically exudative and may be massive, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, tiredness, palatal petechiae, and malaise. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur. Diagnosis is made by the heterophile antibody test (Monospot test -Paul Bunnell-), a screening test that gives results within a day, but has significantly less than full sensitivity (70&ndash;92%) in the first two weeks after clinical symptoms begin. Serological tests take longer time than the heterophile antibody test, but are more accurate.

This lesions are usually painless but may become painful if swollen or inflamed. This lesions may also involve internal organs (e.g. lung leading to dyspnoea, gastrointestinal tract leading life-threatening bleeding and lymphatics leading to lymphoedema). The diagnosis is by tissue biopsy while the extent of disease may be determined by medical imaging.

Fever seen in this patient is caused by a secondary infection of the blisters that require the prescription of oral antibiotics. Chickenpox is the primary infection of varicella-zoster virus. It is important to remember that reactivarion of the dormant virus after a bout of chickenpox leads to herpes zoster (shingles). Chickenpox is a highly infectious airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. Incubation period is about 10 to 21 days. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications. Clinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust. Pruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies. Aciclovir must be administered to pregnant women or immunocompromised patients who develop the disease.

Clinical features include: skin lesions (nodular, papular or blotchy that may be purple, red, brown or black) which can be seen under or on mucous membranes, more often in the mouth, nose and throat.

Chickenpox is a highly infectious airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. Incubation period is about 10 to 21 days. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications. Clinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust. Pruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies.

The first line regimen is Truvada and Raltegravir for 28 days. A follow-up testing is recommended 8-12 weeks after exposure.\nFurther reading:\nhttps://www.bashh.org/documents/PEPSE%202015%20guideline%20final_NICE.pdf\nhttp://www.bhiva.org/documents/guidelines/testing/glineshivtest08.pdf\nTypes of HIV testExample of Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) Risk Assessment ', NULL, 0, 2, NULL, NULL),

Fever seen in this patient is caused by a secondary infection of the blisters that require the prescription of oral antibiotics.\nChickenpox is the primary infection of varicella-zoster virus. It is important to remember that reactivarion of the dormant virus after a bout of chickenpox leads to herpes zoster (shingles). Chickenpox is a highly infectious airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. Incubation period is about 10 to 21 days. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. Disease is usually mild to moderate and self-limiting but immunocompromised patients may develop serious complications.\nClinical features are more severe in adults and include pyrexia (first feature to appear), Itchy rash which start on the headm chest and back before spreading to other sites. Initially the rash is macular, then papular, then vesicular an finally dry crust.\nPruritus is managed by sedating antihistamines and emollients, Calamine use is controversial, some recommeds to reapply ir regularly because its effect stops drying.\nVaricella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) must be given to immunocompromised patients with exposure, newborn with peripartum exposure or pregnant women eith exposure and no varicella antibodies. Aciclovir must be administered to pregnant women or immunocompromised patients who develop the disease.\nReference:\nhttp://patient.info/doctor/chickenpox-pro\nhttps://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg13.pdf\nhttps://cks.nice.org.uk/chickenpox', NULL, 0, 2, NULL, NULL),

(1, 'About Plab Exam', '<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">All About<strong> PLAB</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We live in changing times, and one of the wonderful things we have experienced is the diversity that comes with meeting and working with colleagues from different regions. Understandably when it comes to job migration there are safety aspects that call for robust governance, and in terms of working in the medical and allied professions, new entrants to the UK and other countries not only need to demonstrate professional competence but also skilled use of the English Language. Here in the UK, the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board (PLAB) Exam is currently the main route via which overseas medical staff can demonstrate that their knowledge and skills are of a sufficient standard to work in this country.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The exams are reviewed by PLAB and are amended periodically; the most recent guidance is available here: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a title=\"Click to go\" href=\"https://www.gmc-uk.org/registration-and-licensing/join-the-register/plab/a-guide-to-the-plab-test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GMC UK</a></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We recommend you consult this website as it also gives up to date information on some of the practical and governance aspects of sitting the exam (such as dates, how to register etc). There are currently two exams provided by The Board -</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>PLAB1</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>PLAB 2</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>PLAB 1</h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a computer-based examination multiple choice exam that asks 180 questions about a vast range of medical conditions from different angles. For instance, a question about thyrotoxicosis may focus on assessment, management, genetics, epidemiology, ethics, pharmacology, anatomy etc. It may also be part of an older adult question or a paediatric scenario. Each question / scenario asks for a SINGLE best answer. What we at PrepareMedicine remind people is that the exam is not asking you to memorise information and churn it our mechanically. You are doctors. You see people who may have the same condition as the lady in the next bed but as they have their own individual context, they respond differently. The exam is about holism, looking at the individual and the bigger picture, and choosing current best practice from best evidence provided in the guidance provided by NICE, SIGN, Cochrane reviews etc. It&rsquo;s not about your old hospital&rsquo;s policy or the clinic where a<br />friend works.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The examiners expect you to answer the questions based on a UK context, so we would strongly advise you to be familiar with the routine equipment available in UK healthcare settings (such as point-of-care ultrasound in A&amp;E department for rapid diagnosis of ruptured spleen; you would always choose this over CT scan in an emergency medicine question / scenario where time is of the essence). Also, all prescribing is based on the current edition of the BNF (British National Formulary, available for free via NICE for UK based users, or registering online at:</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a title=\"Click to Register\" href=\"https://www.bnf.org/products/bnf-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click to Register</a></span></strong></p>\r\n<h4>PLAB 2</h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is described as &lsquo;an objective structured clinical exam&rsquo; by The Board. They present you with 18 scenarios, each lasting eight minutes, and they are all based on &lsquo;real life&rsquo;. For instance, there is a ward bay, there is a mock consultation such as in primary care. This is run throughout the year at one of the PLAB Clinical Assessment centres throughout the UK.</p>', NULL, '2020-03-23 18:39:01'),

In Hubei province, there was a slightly higher male (51.4%) to female (48.6%) predominance and the greatest risk of fatality is in the over-60&rsquo;s (especially over 80&rsquo;s); this is compounded by those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer.

class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>Authors: Neeltje van Doremalen, Trenton Bushmaker, Dylan Morris, Myndi Holbrook, Amandine Gamble, Brandi Williamson, Azaibi Tamin, Jennifer Harcourt, Natalie Thornburg, Susan Gerber, Jamie Lloyd-Smith, Emmie de Wit, Vincent Munster (9<sup>th</sup> March 2020)<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Abstract:</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;A novel human coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, referred to as HCoV-19 here) that emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now causing a pandemic. Here, we analyse the aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 and compare it with SARS-CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus.2 We evaluated the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 in aerosols and on different surfaces and estimated their decay rates using a Bayesian regression model</p>\r\n<p>Main findings:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Our findings show that the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 under the experimental circumstances tested is similar. This indicates that differences in the epidemiology of these viruses likely arise from other factors, including high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for individuals infected with HCoV-19 to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic. Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 are plausible, as the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days. This echoes the experience with SARS-CoV-1, where these modes of transmission were associated with nosocomial spread and superspreading events and provides guidance for pandemic mitigation measures&rsquo;.</p>', NULL, '2020-03-23 18:55:25');
